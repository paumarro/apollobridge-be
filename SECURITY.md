## **Cybersecurity Measures Implemented in Railway**

1. **HTTPS Everywhere**  
   - Automatic provisioning of TLS/SSL certificates for all deployed applications, ensuring HTTPS is enforced for secure connections.

2. **Secure Defaults**  
   - Promotes secure configurations by default, such as isolated environments and secure connection strings for databases.

3. **Environment Variables**  
   - Provides a secure mechanism for managing secrets and environment variables, minimizing the risk of exposing sensitive information in codebases.

4. **Infrastructure Security**  
   - Manages server and network-level security, including firewalls and protection against infrastructure-level threats like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

5. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**  
   - Integrates with a CDN to enhance caching and mitigate risks from attacks like DDoS.

6. **Access Control**  
   - Implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users can manage deployments and resources.

7. **Private-Network Communication**
    - Deploys applications in environments where internal services communicate over private IP ranges, reducing exposure to the public internet.

## **Security Measures in the GO Backend**

1. **Input Validation**  
   - Validates all user-provided data to prevent injection attacks, malformed inputs, and other vulnerabilities.

2. **Sanitization**  
   - Cleanses user inputs to remove malicious or unwanted data, ensuring that inputs conform to expected formats and reducing the risk of injection attacks.

3. **Output Encoding**  
   - Encodes data before rendering it to users, safeguarding against injection-based attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

4. **Security Headers**  
   - Enforces headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `Strict-Transport-Security` to protect against browser-based vulnerabilities.

5. **Header Management**  
   - Ensures secure handling of headers such as `Authorization` and `Content-Type` to prevent header injection and maintain proper API communication.

6. **Authentication and Authorization**  
   - Integrates robust identity verification and access control mechanisms, including Keycloak integration, JWT-based authentication, and credential validation.  
   - Role-based access is enforced to ensure that only gallery users can perform sensitive operations like posting, editing, or deleting artworks.

7. **Session Management**  
   - Implements secure session handling with short-lived access tokens (e.g., 10-minute lifespan) and rotating refresh tokens to mitigate token theft risks.

8. **Logging and Monitoring**  
   - Monitors system activity to detect anomalies and provides alerts for potential security incidents.

9. **Database Security**  
   - Enforces database security with measures like parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, access controls, regular audits, and secure interaction via ORMs like `GORM`.

10. **Rate Limiting**  
    - Restricts the number of requests a user or IP can make within a specific timeframe to prevent brute force and denial-of-service attacks.

11. **Dependency Management**  
    - Automates updates and audits of third-party libraries and dependencies through CI pipelines, ensuring they are free from known vulnerabilities using tools like `GOSEC` and `GOVULNCHECK`.
