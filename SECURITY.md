## **Cybersecurity Measures Implemented in Railway**

**HTTPS Everywhere**  
Automatic provisioning of TLS/SSL certificates for all deployed applications, ensuring HTTPS is enforced for secure connections.

**Secure Defaults**  
Promotes secure configurations by default, such as isolated environments and secure connection strings for databases.

**Environment Variables**  
Provides a secure mechanism for managing secrets and environment variables, minimizing the risk of exposing sensitive information in codebases.

**Infrastructure Security**  
Manages server and network-level security, including firewalls and protection against infrastructure-level threats like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

**Content Delivery Network (CDN)**  
Integrates with a CDN to enhance caching and mitigate risks from attacks like DDoS.

**Access Control**  
Implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users can manage deployments and resources.  
- **Regular Users**: Limited access, allowing only the viewing of artworks.  
- **Gallery Users**: Elevated permissions to post, edit, or delete artworks, ensuring sensitive operations are restricted to authorized users.  

**Private-Network Communication**  
Deploys applications in environments where internal services communicate over private IP ranges, reducing exposure to the public internet. Implements network access controls (NAC) and encrypted channels to secure data in transit.

## **Security Measures in the GO Backend**

**Input Validation**  
Validates all user-provided data to prevent injection attacks, malformed inputs, and other vulnerabilities.

**Sanitization**  
Cleanses user inputs to remove malicious or unwanted data, ensuring that inputs conform to expected formats and reducing the risk of injection attacks.

**Output Encoding**  
Encodes data before rendering it to users, safeguarding against injection-based attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Security Headers**  
Enforces headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `Strict-Transport-Security` to protect against browser-based vulnerabilities.

**Header Management**  
Ensures secure handling of headers such as `Authorization` and `Content-Type` to prevent header injection and maintain proper API communication.

**Authentication and Authorization**  
Integrates robust identity verification and access control mechanisms, including Keycloak integration, JWT-based authentication, and credential validation. Role-based access is enforced to ensure that only gallery users can perform sensitive operations like posting, editing, or deleting artworks.

**Session Management**  
Implements secure session handling with short-lived access tokens (e.g., 10-minute lifespan) and rotating refresh tokens to mitigate token theft risks.

**Logging and Monitoring**  
Monitors system activity to detect anomalies and provides alerts for potential security incidents.

**Database Security**  
Enforces database security with measures like parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, access controls, regular audits, and secure interaction via ORMs like `GORM`.

**Rate Limiting**  
Restricts the number of requests a user or IP can make within a specific timeframe to prevent brute force and denial-of-service attacks.

**Dependency Management**  
Automates updates and audits of third-party libraries and dependencies through CI pipelines, ensuring they are free from known vulnerabilities using tools like `GOSEC` and `GOVULNCHECK`.
